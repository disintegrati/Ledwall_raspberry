# ledmatrix-scroll by Andrew Oakley www.aoakley.com Public Domain 2015-10-18
#
# Takes an image file (e.g. PNG) as command line argument and scrolls it
# across a grid of WS2811 addressable LEDs, repeated in a loop until CTRL-C
#
# Use a very wide image for good scrolling effect.
#
# If you have a low resolution matrix (like mine, 12x8 LEDs) then you will
# probably need to create your image height equal to your matrix height
# and draw lettering pixel by pixel (e..g in GIMP or mtpaint) if you want
# words or detail to be legible.
